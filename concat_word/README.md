This application is written in Ruby 2.0 using Rspec for testing.
<h3>Objective</h3>
To complete a coding challenge for a London based tech company.
<h3>Requirements</h3>
Find all six letter words in a dictionary which are composed of two concatenated smaller words.
<h3>Approach</h3>
My approach looked at finding a quick solution, focussing on clean readable code. 

<p>Future refactoring would look at finding a more elegant way to read the words from the dictionary into a string or array. Equally I would  benchmark different solutions to manipulating the dictionary words.</p>
